# Description #

Running is one of the most ubiquitous sports of the world. It is healthy, it is costless, and it is relaxing. However, running could also be overwhelming if we want to keep our motions for a longer time for some people. To run in an effective manner, one should not simply use up all energy in a short burst of time. Therefore, it will be much better if the runner can keep a constant speed.


This Android application aims to help user keep a constant speed during exercise. By using this, "running" becomes more efficient to one's cardio workout; it also trains their stamina to run for a longer time. In this application, a monitor will be used to record the speed and show how fast the pace is. As the slope of the graph in the monitoring program refers to the speed, it will be the key factor to have a consistent speed when exercising. Therefore, we demand an easy and intuitive way to keep tracking our pace; it is not necessary to keep looking at the devices from time to time.

# Features #

## Pace-adjusting Music Player ##

The music player is the dominant feature of the user experience. User can just tap on it and start the program in an easy way. As we mentioned above, the key feature of the program is to help users run in a desired pace. Without this, user probably cannot control it conveniently. Therefore, it is undeniable that the program can function well without it.

The program checks the relative speed with the accelerometer, which can be found in most of cells nowadays. The music speed will be determined by matching the suggested value of the monitor installed. Basically, it serves like a controller which directly connected to the main program. Normally, it looks like a music player which also similar to other player in other pre-installed android phone. The main difference is that the speed controlled feature of the program.

This will definitely differ from other similar programs having this special feature. If the user cannot keep up the pace, the music will be awkward because the music is being played abnormally. It does not make any sense either when the music is played too fast or too slow. So the program can run well having this feature.

## Statistics and Journals ##
For the part of showing statistical data, users can swipe the screen to the left. This assists users can monitor the data right away - distance traveled, pacing and steps taken. Besides, history is provided when swiping the screen to the right. Users could trace back the past performance; at the same time, the real-time record will also be listed in the same page.

## Goals and achievements ##

The application would also present a list of goals to users, letting users select their favorable routine before exercising. Achievement list is also available to users. Users are encouraged as they are assessed with targets.

## Social Integration ##
This program is connected to either Facebook or Twitter. The performance record can be shared among these platforms. As the individual performance are shared with friends, it is like a booster to encourage people to achieve the goal.
