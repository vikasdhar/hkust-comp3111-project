**2. Discussion of impediments and resolution**

Last week, we have just finished the part of SVN. And found out all of us can successfully push and pull the program from the google code. Database has already been setup which allows the program to run.

However, Chau Ho Yin Leung Wai Man find that the Program still contains some minor errors(crashed when no music file exists), which should not affect the entire program. Therefore, in order to fix the problem, CHau And Leung is going to try to throw exception to avoid any similar crash happens again.

The rest of us is going to test for the rest of program and further implement the social platform for the program. And we will use different APIs and see whether we can fit the program or not.
