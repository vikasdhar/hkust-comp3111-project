**2. Discussion of impediments and resolution**


Initially, we planned to have to the meeting on Skype. However , time is running short, so we finally change the mind to have the meeting in UST.
Then discussion can be easier, pair programming can be done and efficiency can be improved.

In the past week, we have done quite a lot of work as there is a holiday. For example, Chau Ho Yin has added gson library and starting to work on the Achievement activity. Chan Chun Hang has finished the part of facebook linkage. As to merge with main app needs to add the facebook sdk library and other libraries,and this may interfere other parts of the app, he and Chau Ho Yin decide to merge them later, may be the next week. Also, Leung Wai Man has amended the music player to make it run faster.
