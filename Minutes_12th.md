**2. Discussion of impediments and resolution**

Last week, everyone has almost finished his jobs on separate part of the app. Chung Chun Cheung and Chau Ho Yin worked on the achievement part, they met some problems, and solved. Chan Chun Hang completed the "click to share to facebook" function on an individual application, he is now finding the way to merge. Leung Wai Man added swipe to add song and swipe to delete song from playlist function.

In the coming week, we will have the finally presentation. We expect we can finish our application on the presentation day. We are now working hard on prototype and the test cases.
