**2. Discussion of impediments and resolution**

After finishing the project presentation, our group have started to write the requirement, and continue to work on the project.

Chan Chun Hang and Chau Ho Yin met some difficulties in their own parts, i.e. Facebook linkage and Pedometer. For example, Chan met some eclipse minor error messages like “jar mismatch”. The solution is simply removing the android-support-v4.jar file from the libs folder from the project file because there is also an android-support-v4.jar file in the Facebook sdk which causes the conflict. They solved the difficulties after researching on google and books.

Meanwhile, our group have almost finished writing the requirements. Some parts which are more difficult like Joint Achievement, Social Synchronization and Interface of the Statistics part are discussed in the meeting. It is supposed all parts of the requirement will be finished on Saturday.
