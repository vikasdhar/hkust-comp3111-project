**2. Discussion of impediments and resolution**

Leung Wai Man was making the music player. He found some prototype on the Internet, and try to modify and group them, so that more functions will be available.

Chan Chun Hang made a class related to a the calculation of some statistical data. For example, the calorie burnt due to running. This required some formulas from the internet.

Tai Sze Pok Alfred and Chung Chun Cheung were working on data base design. They met some difficulties, and tried to solve them with the help of Chau Ho Yin.

Chau Ho Yin made the draft interface of the application, which runs quite smoothly. He waited for the class made by Chan Chun Hang to complete the pedometer part.
