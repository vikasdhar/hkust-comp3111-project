**2. Discussion of impediments and resolution**

After the presentation, our group continue to work on prototype.
For the extended music player, Leung Wai Man found it lags when scrolling the songs list. He fixed it by using the recycling properties of list item. And now, the list can be scrolled more smoothly, but it still a bit lag. He will fix it later.

Chau Ho Yin and Chung Chun Cheung grouped they part into one. Chung Chun Cheung made personal data base to allow user to add their personal information to the app. Chau Ho Yin improved the GUI of the app, and tried to enhance user experience when using the app.

Since there is a holiday in the coming week, we may not go back to UST. We will use skpye to hold a meeting. Or, just skip one meeting in the coming week.
