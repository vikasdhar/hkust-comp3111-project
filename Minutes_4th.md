**2. Discussion of impediments and resolution**

After finishing the requirement, we come back to the implementation of the project. Chan Chun Hang| has done with the ��sign in�� part of the Facebook. In addition to the requirement, project backlog is also done last week.

This week, we have learnt about the SVN in the tutorial and lab session. We tried to use it in our project, so that the upload of documents like minutes and requirement becomes more efficient.

Moreover, we can synchronize the source code with the use of Google code. Chau Ho Yin put some initial code on the Google code by SVN. And others will do so this week.

Chau Ho Yin and Leung Wai Man are going to group their code together in the coming week as a simple trial. However, they will continue to work and develop on their own part separately after the trial.
