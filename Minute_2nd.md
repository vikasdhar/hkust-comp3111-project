2. Discussion of impediments and resolution

Apart from the project proposal, our group have also started to work on the project. Chan Chun Hang and Leung Wai Man met some difficulties in their own parts, i.e. Facebook linkage and music player. To deal with, they decided to research on their topic.

Meanwhile, Chau Ho Yin and Tai Sze Pok Alfred wrote the requirements of their parts briefly. They have successfully implemented some of the part, for example, getting data from the accelerometer and displaying it the screen as a curve.
